This was our first backend semester assignment for our first year in highschool.
The assignment was to be able to code something similar to another big company's website using backend. (Netflix, Nike, ODEON etc.)
I used Nike as an inspiration, I called the website "Mike" and changed up a little so it wasn't all copy, but I used some of the same images for the shoes.
The copy I made was for an older version of their website, cbut I think it still looks pretty similar.
I used PgAdmin4 as my database, I added some pictures in the documentation.
